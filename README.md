# Smart_Pricing_AirBnB

Welcome to the AirBNB House Price Prediction Project! This repository contains the code and resources needed to predict house prices for AirBNB listings using machine learning techniques. 

## Introduction

This project aims to predict the prices of AirBNB listings based on various features such as location, number of bedrooms, amenities, and more. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can provide more accurate pricing recommendations to potential hosts and help guests find better deals.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data.

2. **Model Training**: Train the machine learning model using the preprocessed data.

3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model.

## Modeling Approach

The project employs various machine learning algorithms to predict house prices. The steps involved include:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset through visualizations and statistical analysis.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
3. **Model Training**: Training different regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and more.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

## Results

The results of the models are documented in the notebook. We compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing one based on evaluation metrics.
